# What is a wireframe?
well Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers that allows them to define and edit the knowledge based on the website, application, or product design. This process focuses on whether the designer or client requires the user to process the information on the site, based on user research conducted by the UX construction team.

## How to make your Wireframe look good 	&#128511;:
* **Clarity**

Your wireframe needs to answer questions about what that site page is,what the user can do there, and if it meets their needs. Your wireframe is useful for you to visualize the layout of your site page and ensure that the most important user questions are answered and the goals happen without being distracted by ideas of beauty

* **Confidence**

The ease of navigating your site and specifying a call to action increases user confidence in your product. If your site page is unexpected, or has buttons or boxes in unexpected places the user's confidence decreases. This large amount of information can already be organized on the call stage.

Using familiar navigational processes and placing buttons in commonly used and intuitive positions, user confidence will soar and that’s before you’ve even gotten around to thinking about colors and styles.

* **Simplicity**

**Too much information**, **copy**, **or links**, can be distracting to the user and will have a detrimental affect on your users’ ability to achieve their goals.
